# Super Mario 64 - Dark Edition

## Introduction

This is a custom romhack of the videogame Super Mario 64 for Nintendo 64. It retextures the game with heavy
inspiration of the popular "Blindfolded Speedruns". The levels and models are 1:1 equal to vanilla, so 
experienced players can test themselves if they manage to navigate these levels by muscle memory or the 
limited visual cues. This hack works on all common emulators, Wii VC through WAD injection, as well as
original N64 hardware through e.g. an Everdrive 64.

## Changes to SM64

Most level models in this game are retextured completely transparent/black. Some objects have kept
their original texture to allow a smoother gameplay. These include most importantly:

- Coins of all kinds
- Enemies of all kinds
- Interactive objects like switches
- Doors / Level Entrances


I was not able to retexture all the objects I wanted with the limitations given by Quad 64 (https://github.com/DavidSM64/Quad64).
The known ones include:

- Stone textures in JRB (have a light shader or something that makes them grey)
- TTC platforms (same as JRB stones)
- Color Planes like in WF (yellow arrows), SA (window colors), Firesea (side of lava platforms, tiny triangles on grid platform second floor)
- Quicksand in SSL

If someone with more hacking knowledge wants to fix these things, I would appreciate it.

## How to Play

You can use a patching program like flips (https://www.smwcentral.net/?a=details&id=11474&p=section) or the romhacking.com system to 
apply this romhack patch (.bps) to a unedited vanilla rom (NTSC-U). You will need to obtain the rom yourself as distribution is illegal.

## Tips/Tricks

This hack is meant as a challenge to test if you know the game well enough to beat it even with limited vision.
It goes without saying that it is a rather challenging hack and beginners will probably struggle with it.
That is why I want to list a few tips and tricks here:

- If you get stuck at a specific star, I recommend checking the blindfolded speedrun strategies for it. There is a high chance that strats from there can be applied to this hack. My 120 Star completion can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC_ClvO-FZE. 
- Use Mario's model to identify objects! Sometimes you can recognize object with standing behind them with Mario's model. You can for example locate poles like in the beginning of Firesea by turning the camera in a specific way!
- Practice stars with the visuals of the vanilla game!
